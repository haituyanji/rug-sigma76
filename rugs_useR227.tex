% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Interesting companies}
\begin{frame}[t,label=current]
  \frametitle{Tibco}
  Tibco is the company that bought over Insightful. With Tibco's Spotfire
  sofware, you can:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Get access to a broad array of predictive analytic and cutting-edge
    statistical analysis tools.
  \item Develop analytics applications as much as five times faster.
  \item Extend these tools with functions from a contributed package 
    \href{http://csan.insightful.com}{CSAN repository}.
  \only<2->{\item Also working on a new implementation of the S language, that
    is focused on improving the memory management issues of R.}
  \only<2->{\item What defines the S language?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Brown (1984) $\rightarrow$ Blue (1988) $\rightarrow$ White (1992) 
        $\rightarrow$ Green (1998).
    \end{itemize}}
%S was first introduced by Becker and Chambers (1984) in what's known as the
%'brown' book. The new S language was described by Becker, Chambers and Wilks
%(1988) in the 'blue' book. Chambers and Hastie (1992) edited a book discussing
%statistical modeling in S, called the 'white' book. The latest version of the S
%language is described by Chambers (1998) in the 'green' book, but R is largely
%an implementation of the versions documented in the blue and white books.
%Chamber's (2008) latest book focuses on Programming with R.
% MENTION LEXICAL SCOPING.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Mango Solutions}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item A UK based company, started in 2002.
   \item They provide the following services:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Consulting 
      \item Training, and 
      \item R validation.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \pause
  \begin{block}{What I understand from this:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item More people \emph{want} to use the analysis tools within R.
      \item Like Android, it is getting difficult to maintain compatibility
        across versions of R and of packages.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Interesting concepts}
\begin{frame}[fragile,label=current]
  \frametitle{R version 3.0.0 - what's new?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Duncan Murdoch gave a talk on the latest version of R.
    \item What does R x.y.z actually mean? \pause
    \item Support for numeric indices $2^{31}$ and larger. So now
    \begin{verbatim}
    > x[2^31] <- y
    \end{verbatim}
    will work on 64-bit machines, extending the x-vector if necessary. \pause
    \item Bounds checking when calling compiled code. \pause
    \item Vignettes can now be written with engines other than Sweave. Any
      engine that processes R code + documentation to create a latex file can 
      be used, e.g. knitr. See this
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Non_002dSweave-vignettes}{page} 
      in the Writing R Extensions section. \pause
    \item What exactly has helped in the dramatic increase in R users? \pause
    % framework for sharing code, repeated answers by Duncan.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=current]
  \frametitle{BigR Data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hadley Wickham gave a talk on handling bigger data in R
    \item The full talk can be found here: \url{http://bit.ly/bigrdata2}
    \item ``Visualisation reveals the unexpected but does not scale well; models
      scale well, but they are so precise that they seldom reveal new things''
    \item Who doesn't use at least one of reshape2, plyr or ggplot2?
    \item Two new packages for handling big big data:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item dplyr
        \item bigvis
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{MCMC or INLA?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Havard Rue gave a talk on R-INLA
    \item Steve Scott gave a talk on BOOM
    % mention Google correlate
    \item Both are methods for carrying out Bayesian inference.
    \item Although the latter is more general, I am keen to learn about INLA.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Naming conventions in R}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A humorous talk on the inconsistencies of R users!
    \item Even base R does not one of the following consistently:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item lowerCamelCase
      \item upperCamelCase
      \item alllowercase
      \item period.separated 
      \item underscore\_separated
      \end{itemize}
    \item Read more about it
\href{http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012-2/RJournal_2012-2_Baaaath.pdf}
{here}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Interesting packages}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{data.table Package}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item data.table can be thought of as providing an enhanced data frame.
    \item When used correctly, it can be much faster than a data.frame
    \item The main features are:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Use of keys for indexing rows. 
        \item Fast grouping
        \item Fast time series joins.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Must learn packages (from my p.o.v, of course}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shiny!
    \item knitr (and markdown)
    \item ??
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
